<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>2</b> tablespoons butter, cut into three even pieces</li>
    <li><b>1</b> hot dog, cut into 4 thin slices lengthwise</li>
    <li><b>2</b> slices hearty white bread, such as Pepperidge Farm or Arnold</li>
    <li><b>2</b> slices American, cheddar, or Jack cheese</li>
    <li><b>1/2</b> cup your favorite chili</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Melt one third of butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until foaming subsides. Add hot dog
        slices and
        cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add both bread slices and cook,
        swirling
        occasionally, until pale golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer bread to a cutting board toasted-side-up. Place cheese slices on top of each slice. Add hot dogs and
        chili to
        one side, then close sandwich, with both toasted sides facing inwards.
    </li>
    <li>Melt one more piece of butter in the skillet and reduce heat to medium low. Add sandwich and cook, swirling
        occasionally, until deep, even golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sandwich using a flexible metal spatula.
        Add the
        remaining butter. Return sandwich to skillet cooked-side up. Season with salt. Cook, swirling occasionally,
        until second
        side is deep, even golden brown and cheese is thoroughly melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
    </li>
</ol>
