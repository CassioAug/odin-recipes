    <h1>Crispy Roast Potatoes</h1>

    <img class="r-img" src="potatoes.webp" alt="A picture of some delicious roast potatoes.">

    <p>These are the <strong>most</strong> flavorful crispy roast potatoes you'll ever make. And they just happen to be
        gluten-free and vegan <em>(if you use oil)</em> to boot.</p>

</div>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li><b>1/2</b> teaspoon (4g) baking soda</li>
    <li><b>4</b> pounds (about 2 kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths,
        depending on size (see note)</li>
    <li><b>5</b> tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat</li>
    <li>Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped</li>
    <li><b>3</b> medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection).
        Heat 2
        quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce;
        25g),
        baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little
        resistance
        when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a
        small
        saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn
        golden,
        about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary
        mixture
        aside and reserve separately.</li>
    <li>When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess
        moisture to
        evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to
        coat,
        shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.</li>
    <li>Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven
        and
        roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake
        pan and
        turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a
        few times
        during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.</li>
    <li>Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season
        with more
        salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
